# WBS_1_Project_Eniac_Magist

## Summary
Eniac, a well-established online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, is considering expanding into the Brazilian market within a tight one-year deadline. While Eniac has extensive experience operating its own supply chain in Europe, it lacks local knowledge, providers, and logistics infrastructure in Brazil.

To facilitate market entry, Eniac is negotiating a three-year partnership with Magist, a Brazilian SaaS company that connects small and medium-sized businesses to major marketplaces. Magist also provides essential services such as stock management, product shipment, and customer service.

While economic terms are being discussed, concerns have been raised within Eniac regarding product compatibility with Magist’s network and delivery speed. To address these concerns, Magist has provided Eniac with a snapshot of their database, which will be analyzed before making a final decision.

## Key Learnings
This project provided invaluable experience of the data analysis lifecycle, from data cleaning to advanced SQL queries, Tableau visualisation and insightful interpretation. I honed my analytical and problem-solving skills while overcoming challenges such as handling large datasets and ensuring data accuracy. This project not only strengthened my technical expertise, but also enhanced my ability to effectively communicate complex data findings to non-technical audiences, reinforcing the critical role of data-driven decision making in business scenarios.
